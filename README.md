## Options

![ComfyUI-Thumbnails-options](/assets/ComfyUI-Thumbnails-options.webp)

| Attribute | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `Show File Names` | False |
| `Show Thumbnails` | True |
| `Thumbnails Size` | 100 |

Thumbnails are lazy loaded, and sized by their max-height. It looks better that way, almost like a masonery. Example without filenames:

## Known Issues
- Images loaded from subfolders will not close the parent folder yet. Just click anywhere to close the dialog.
- does not handle more than 1 level of subfolders

## RoadMap

### Goal: 1.30
- [ ] fix parent root folder not closing or live with it
- [x] browse subfolders of input - yay we did it!
  - [x] fix subfolder image calls: view&subfolder=folder stopped working
  - [x] pass subfolders as objects in py
  - [x] show subfolders as folder icon
  - [x] disable deleteBtn on folders
  - [x] remove litegraph event listener
  - [x] build actual list for files and subfolders in py
  - [x] replace [object Object] by folder name
  - [x] pass folders and their content to addImg
  - [x] create thisSubRoot content with subfolder files - kind of
  - [x] add .. folder to thisSubRoot
  - [x] store thisRoot in local storage - just files dictionary
  - [x] replace thisRoot content with new subfolder content with new click listener
  - [ ] have a good night sleep
